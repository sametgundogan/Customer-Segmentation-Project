# Customer-Segmentation-Project

In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall. 
I performed Cluster Analysis with an Unsupervised Learning method. I used hopkins test, checked silhouette scores and looked the elbow method
to implement KMeans algorithm.

At the end, I interpretted the clusters by its features and tried to give some suggestions to client about what they can do :)

I hope it will be helpful...
